# Welcome to my first public repository
 
So far I've learned how to
1. Get setup with Git and Github
  1. Installing Git
  2. Signing up Github
2. Use the **command line**
3. Push code to a **repository**
4. Merge code using
  1. git merge
  2. Github's pull requests
5. Creating README files
 
[I learned all this from Code Institute!](http://codeinstitute.net)


DATE: 20th April 2017 - I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO SAVE TEXT FILES FROM TEXTEDIT OR
FROM TEXT WRANGLER AS .MD FILES, 
so am copying the content from the other README.  SO MUCH FOR VERSION CONTROL!!

# CodeInstitute-Stream1-Project2.0
My first, NAY SECOND, repository
<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello, world, intro

Hello, world intro.

So it has been at least since the 26th March, when I began the seemingly simple task of 
getting my head around this GitHub shit.  And I find it outrageously annoying that GitHub 
does not seemingly have an responsive design....all this text keeps on being typed outside 
the visual window!!

UPDATE on 18th April
Yesterday's session with Gary Nelson for 1.5 hours was invaluable. 
First bit of feedback: no one would really use the command line.
BUT, we both agreed that mastering the command line would represent a good understanding
 of the fundamentals of Git and Github, the processes and workflows.
SECOND INSIGHT: was the workflow of
 CHANGE --> ADD --> COMMIT [to local, with message!] --> PUSH -U(pstream)
