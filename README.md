Hello, world, intro

Hello, world intro.

So it has been at least since the 26th March, when I began the seemingly simple task of getting my head around this GitHub shit.  And I find it outrageously annoying that GitHub does not seemingly have an responsive design....all this text keeps on being typed outside the visual window!!

UPDATE on 18th April
Yesterday's session with Gary Nelson for 1.5 hours was invaluable. 
First bit of feedback: no one would really use the command line.
BUT, we both agreed that mastering the command line would represent a good understanding of the fundamentals of Git and Github, the processes and workflows.
SECOND INSIGHT: was the workflow of CHANGE --> ADD --> COMMIT [to local, with message!] --> PUSH -U(pstream)
